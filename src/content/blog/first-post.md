Welcome to the blog!

This is my first post on the newly refactored site using Astro. I'm excited to share more thoughts and projects here.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro because...

*   It's fast!
*   Great Markdown support.
*   Allows using UI components (React, Vue, etc.) if needed.

Stay tuned for more updates!
